# Vue 3 DataTable with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## Summary

This project uses a public JSON file and builds a single-page, responsive, and sortable table using Vue 3, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The JSON data is retrieved from the URL: [https://content.launchbrightly.com/lbdemo/baremetrics.json](https://content.launchbrightly.com/lbdemo/baremetrics.json). The table columns include "ID", "Name", "Description", "Editions" and "Time of Screenshot". Column headers are clickable for ascending/descending sorting, and the "Editions" column has a filter that works with sorting.
